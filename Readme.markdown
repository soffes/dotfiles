Based on [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles), [Ryan Tomayko](http://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles), and [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

## Installation

    $ cd ~
    $ git init
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/soffes/dotfiles.git
    $ git pull origin main
    $ ~/Scripts/install.sh

## Stuff To Change

**Please change the `.gitconfig` so you don't commit everything as me.** You'll also need to remove the `signingkey` option under my email and the `commit` section at the bottom of that file. Everything else shouldn't need tweaking.

Enjoy.
